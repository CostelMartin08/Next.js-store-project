**Project Title:** *Development of an online store using Next.js and Tailwind CSS*

**Description:**

The project involves the development of a fully functional online store, which utilizes modern technologies such as Next.js and Tailwind CSS to provide a fast, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing user experience. The store will allow users to browse and purchase products from a wide range of categories.

**Key Features:**

 Navigation and Product Display: Users can explore and search for products within the store, using an intuitive navigation system and well-defined categories. Products are displayed in an attractive and informative manner, facilitating purchasing decisions.

**Technologies Used:**

Next.js: React framework for web development, offering advanced features such as server-side rendering and routing.

Tailwind CSS: Useful CSS framework for quick and efficient styling of the user interface.

Prisma: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for interacting with the database and managing data.

MongoDB: Document-oriented database management system, used for storing and managing application-specific data such as product information, user data, and orders.

**Project Objectives:**

Integrating MongoDB for storing and managing essential data of the application, such as product information, user data, and orders.
Using Prisma for interacting with the MongoDB database, providing a level of abstraction and ease of working with data.
Ensuring the security and integrity of data within the system by implementing appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Optimizing the performance of the application and interaction with the database for a fast and responsive user experience.
